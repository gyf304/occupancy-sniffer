HXDT, or HTTP XTEA Data Transfer is a protocol on top of HTTP/1.1 to facilitate
simple encrypted and authenticated data transfer with existing web servers. 
HXDT is designed for use as a remote procedural call protocol - each request
corresponds to a response.

HXDT utilizes big-endian version of XTEA in CTR + CBC MAC (CCM) mode.
CTR SHOULD use 32-bit random nonce, with remaining 32 bits set to 0.
CBC MAC MUST use the predefined IV of 0.

Note that HXDT itself does not prevent replay attack. Although it can be
mitigated by storing IV (CTR counter) on server and invalidating repeated IVs.

8-15    XTEA-IV (CTR counter), big-endian.
16-23   XTEA-CBC-MAC, big-endian.
24++    XTEA-CTR Data, big-endian.
